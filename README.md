A bunch of algorithms that are implemented in ruby.

To run tests, install rspec from command-line.
```shell
gem install rspec
```


## Algorithms for which there are tests

- memoized fibonacci
- dynamic fibonacci
- recursive edit distance
- dynamic edit distance
- matrix multiplier


## Algorithms to Implement

- merge sort
- knapsack
- Dijkstra's
